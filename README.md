TrainScheduler

The trainscheduler allows users to add trains including their initial departure time and once the train is added the next time of the train is automatically calculated.  This is very simple in design as there is a lot of information on the page.  The clean and simple look allows for users to review all of the information without feeling overwhelmed with the information in front of them.

This project shows the use of javascript as well as using momentjs.  The calcualtions are based off of information included by the user as well as the current time which is from momentjs.

This was created using bootstrap, javascript, firebase and momentjs.
